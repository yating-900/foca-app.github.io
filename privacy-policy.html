            <p><strong>When you use our services, you&#x27;re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.</strong></p>
            <p>By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:foca-2020@outlook.com">foca-2020@outlook.com</a>

            <h3><strong>Information Foca Collects</strong></h3>
            <h4><strong>Your activity &amp; apps</strong></h4>
            <p>At the time you register for Foca, you voluntarily give us information such as your name and email address. You have the access and can update this information under your personal Account Settings at any time. We also collect aggregated, anonymous user data about the use of the app.</p>
            <h4><strong>Information Related to Use of the Services</strong></h4>
            <p>Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as &quot;Log Data&quot;), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a &quot;User&quot;). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>
            <h4><strong>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</strong></h4>
            <p>We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Why Foca Collects Data</strong></h3>
            <p>We use data to build better services. Your information will not be shared with others and will only be used internally for the purposes described below:</p>
            <h4><strong>Provide our services</strong></h4>
            <p>We use your information to deliver our services or information you requested, and to process and complete any transactions.</p>
            <h4><strong>Maintain &amp; improve our services</strong></h4>
            <p>We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services - for example, to analyze usage and trends with anonymous user data, and to improve the quality of our service and user experience.</p>
            <h4><strong>Communicate with you</strong></h4>
            <p>Foca collects email addresses from those who communicate with us via email, as well as information provided through voluntary activities such as site registration or survey participation. We use the information we collect to interact with you directly.</p>
            <h4><strong>Protect Foca, our users, and the public</strong></h4>
            <p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Foca, our users, or the public.</p>
            <p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We&#x27;ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn&#x27;t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You&#x27;re also welcome to contact us and ask for our confirmation whenever you feel concerned about how your personal information is being processed, where and for what purpose.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Your Privacy Controls</strong></h3>
            <p>While Foca owns the Foca application&#x27;s code, databases, and all rights, you retain all rights to your data. You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it&#x27;s used. Foca will never sell your personal data with a third party, and we will never share data to third parties without your permission. When absolutely necessary, Foca uses third party services and hosting partners who are GDPR-compliant. In such instances, we take essential security methods to guarantee that we comply with GDPR when sending and receiving data from third parties.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
            <p>Cookies are required on Foca&#x27;s Website. We use them to collect visitors&#x27; preferences and thus to better optimize the user experience. Users can disable cookies in their browser settings. But please note that our services rely on cookies to function properly, and you may not be able to access certain features on our Website after disabling them.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Information Security</strong></h3>
            <p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>If our Privacy Policy changes at some time in the future, we will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date the latest changes were published. If changes are significant, we&#x27;ll provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).</p>
            <p>Please check back periodically to keep informed of updates or changes to this Privacy Policy. By continuing to access and to use Foca, you are agreeing to be bound by the revised policy.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
